docker run -d -p 80:80 dockersamples/101-tutorial

You'll notice a few flags being used. Here's some more info on them:

    -d - run the container in detached mode (in the background)
    -p 80:80 - map port 80 of the host to port 80 in the container
    dockersamples/101-tutorial - the image to use



Three things that make up a  container

1. Namespace
2. Control Groups
3. Union FileSystem


Namespace wraps a global system resource in such a way that the process running inside it has own isolated instance of the global resource

Cgroups are the linux kernel feature that allows process to be organised into heirarchial structure whose resources can be monitored and limited

Union filesystem allows files and directories of sperate file system to be transparently overlaid forming  a single coherent file system
